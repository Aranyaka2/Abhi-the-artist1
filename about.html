                    <h3>Sustainable Artistry: The Use of Natural Colors</h3>
                    <p>
                        Abhi is deeply committed to preserving the authenticity and sustainability of traditional art forms. He meticulously extracts pigments from natural sources such as stones, leaves, and minerals, ensuring that each piece of art is not only visually stunning but also environmentally responsible. This practice reflects his reverence for nature and his desire to honor the rich artistic heritage of Kerala, where natural dyes have been used for centuries in mural paintings and other art forms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By using these organic materials, Abhi creates works that are timeless, vibrant, and imbued with the essence of the earth. His dedication to this craft underscores his belief that art should harmonize with the environment rather than exploit it.
